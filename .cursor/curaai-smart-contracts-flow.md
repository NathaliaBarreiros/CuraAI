# CuraAI Smart Contracts: Complete Flow & Testing Strategy

## 🏥 **What CuraAI Smart Contracts Do**

CuraAI's smart contracts create a **privacy-preserving medical data collection system** that enables statistical analysis without compromising individual patient privacy using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).

## 🔄 **Complete User Flow**

### **1. Patient Registration & Data Submission**

#### **User Journey:**
1. **Patient opens CuraAI app** → Connects wallet via Privy
2. **Completes medical profile** → Fills demographic information
3. **Data gets encrypted** → Client-side FHE encryption happens
4. **Submits to blockchain** → Encrypted data stored permanently
5. **Gets confirmation** → Transaction receipt & event emitted

#### **What happens behind the scenes:**
- Patient's data (age, gender, country) gets **packed into a single 32-bit integer**
- Data is **encrypted using FHE** before leaving the user's device
- Smart contract **validates the user hasn't submitted before** (prevents double-counting)
- Contract **extracts and processes encrypted fields** without ever decrypting them
- **Real-time statistics get updated** across all demographic categories

### **2. Encrypted Data Processing**

#### **Smart Contract Logic Flow:**
```
Encrypted Input → Validation → Field Extraction → Statistics Update → Storage
```

**Step-by-step breakdown:**
1. **Receives encrypted patient data** with cryptographic proof
2. **Converts external encryption** to internal FHE format
3. **Extracts individual fields** from packed data:
   - Bits 0-7: Age (encrypted)
   - Bits 8-15: Gender (encrypted) 
   - Bits 16-31: Country (encrypted)
4. **Updates demographic counters** using encrypted arithmetic:
   - Gender statistics (Female, Male, Non-binary, Prefer not to say)
   - Age group statistics (15-20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61+)
   - Country statistics (Ecuador, Argentina, Brasil, US, Canada, Francia)
5. **Stores individual encrypted data** for the user
6. **Emits events** for front-end notification

### **3. Statistical Aggregation (Privacy-Preserving)**

#### **How Statistics Work:**
- **Real-time updates**: Every new patient automatically updates all relevant counters
- **Encrypted operations**: All arithmetic happens on encrypted values
- **Conditional logic**: Smart contract determines which counters to increment using FHE comparisons
- **No data leakage**: Individual data never gets decrypted on-chain

#### **Example Statistical Update Flow:**
```
New Patient: 25-year-old Female from Ecuador
↓
Gender Check: if (gender == 1) → increment femaleCount
Age Check: if (age >= 21 && age <= 30) → increment ageGroup21_30  
Country Check: if (country == 1) → increment ecuadorCount
Total: increment totalPatients
```

## 🧪 **Smart Contract Testing Strategy**

### **Test Categories & Coverage**

#### **1. Deployment & Initialization Tests**
**What they verify:**
- ✅ Contract deploys successfully to local blockchain
- ✅ All counter variables initialize to encrypted zero
- ✅ Contract address is valid and accessible
- ✅ Gas consumption is within reasonable limits

**Why this matters:**
- Ensures the contract can be deployed to any EVM-compatible network
- Verifies initial state is clean for statistical accuracy
- Confirms deployment costs are manageable

#### **2. Interface & Function Existence Tests**
**What they verify:**
- ✅ All public functions are accessible
- ✅ Function signatures match expected interface
- ✅ Contract ABI is correctly generated
- ✅ Events are properly defined

**Critical functions tested:**
- `submitPatientData()` - Main data submission
- `getMyEncryptedData()` - Individual data retrieval  
- `getStatistics()` - Aggregate statistics access
- `getCountryStatistics()` - Country-specific data
- `hasPatientData()` - Registration status check

**Why this matters:**
- Frontend can reliably interact with all contract functions
- Third-party integrations have stable API to work with
- Contract interface remains consistent across deployments

#### **3. Access Control & Security Tests**
**What they verify:**
- ✅ **Registered users only**: Only patients who submitted data can view statistics
- ✅ **Individual privacy**: Users can only access their own encrypted data
- ✅ **Double submission prevention**: Same user cannot submit data twice
- ✅ **Unauthorized access blocked**: Non-registered users get proper error messages

**Security scenarios tested:**
```
Test: Non-registered user tries to view statistics
Expected: Transaction reverts with "Must be registered user"

Test: User tries to view another user's data  
Expected: Only returns data for requesting user

Test: User submits data twice
Expected: Second submission fails with "Patient data already exists"
```

**Why this matters:**
- Protects patient privacy at the smart contract level
- Ensures statistical integrity (no duplicate entries)
- Prevents unauthorized data access even if frontend is compromised

#### **4. Event System Tests**
**What they verify:**
- ✅ `PatientDataSubmitted` event fires on successful submission
- ✅ `StatisticsUpdated` event fires when counters change
- ✅ Events contain correct data and are properly indexed
- ✅ Frontend can listen to events for real-time updates

**Event flow tested:**
```
Patient submits data → PatientDataSubmitted(patientAddress)
Statistics update → StatisticsUpdated(newTotalCount)
Frontend listens → Updates UI automatically
```

**Why this matters:**
- Enables real-time UI updates without constant polling
- Provides audit trail of all data submissions
- Allows analytics and monitoring of contract usage

## 🔒 **Privacy & Encryption Flow**

### **Data Privacy Guarantees**

#### **What Gets Encrypted:**
1. **Individual patient data**: Age, gender, country code
2. **Statistical counters**: All demographic aggregations
3. **Intermediate calculations**: All arithmetic operations

#### **What Remains Visible:**
1. **Transaction metadata**: User addresses, gas costs, timestamps
2. **Contract events**: That a submission occurred (but not the data)
3. **Function calls**: Which functions were called (but not with what data)

#### **Privacy Flow:**
```
Patient Data (Plaintext) 
    ↓ 
Client-side FHE Encryption
    ↓
Encrypted Data + Proof
    ↓
Smart Contract Processing (Encrypted)
    ↓
Encrypted Storage + Updated Encrypted Statistics
    ↓
Only Authorized Decryption (User's own data)
```
